When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working together with others, but also if I want to work from another computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you work on something and the remote changes this could introduce bugs.
